<p>This is a new project for me. I am just getting going understanding what is possible with applying algorithmic / machine learning filtering to images and video. You are welcome to contact me about this work, as I'm happy to answer questions as I have the time and come up for air.</p>
<p>The best ways to reach me is:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/kinlane/algo.rotoscope.work/issues"><strong>Submit Github Issue</strong></a> - These stay associated with the project, and end up in my inbox.</p>
<p><a href="mailto: info@apievangelist.com"><strong>Email</strong></a> - You are welcome to email me directly, but I only give limited time to my inbox, unless prioritized by project (Github), or otherwise.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane/"><strong>Twitter </strong></a>- I'm usually pretty responsive to a Tweet or DM.</p>
<p>I am happy to entertain questions, and even possibly work in applying algorithmic rotoscoping to other video projects. It is a costly thing to accomplish in both time and compute / storage capacity, but is worthwhile exploring if you are looking to transform your video.</p>
<p>Let me know your thoughts!</p>
