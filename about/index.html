	<p>Technology is an escape for me. It provides me an easy way to check out of what is happening around me. This can have a postive or negative impact on my reality depending on how approach it, and the impact on other human beings in my life. I would say that this project helped me escape during the 2016 election, but it has also provided me with another lens to look at the impact technology is making in our lives. As part of my regular work as the API Evangelist I am regularly frustrated by my inability to articulate what is going on online behind the scenes of leading platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Youtube, and others. My algorotoscope work reflects my continued desire to be able to visualize what is happening around us at the intersection of our physical and online worlds.</p>
	<p>If you are interested in learning more about how I got here I recommend looking through the updates for this prooject. I did a fairly decent job of telling the story along the way. My narrative about my algorotoscope work right now centers around me having a pretty stable process established for researching and identifying new images to use when training my machine learning models. I also finally have a stable Amazon machine image with everything setup for training and applying the models. It costs me about $100.00 USD to train each ML odel to acceptable levels, with the results will always vary from photo to photo. Other than still dealing with some scalability issues in versioning each batch I produce, I have things pretty dialed in--I just need to be able to afford to do the work. It ain't cheap.</p>
	<p>Algorotoscope has me thinking more about the mechanics of art, and how things go together. It also has me thinking differently about how I take photos, for both use in training filters, but also applying my filters to photos that I take. I'm just looking for different things when I am walking down the street now. Wondering how it wiill react when a specific filter is applied, or how an object might be isolated and used as part of some specific storytelling. It is an interesting visual cybernetic experiment. Using machine learning to extract textures and (hopefully) some meaning from work you do not own, then apply that extracted essence to photos that you do own, trying to make a point. Highlight how technology is emotionally charging a topic, or how humans are overestimating the power of the Internet, AI, or some other technological trend. My algorotoscope work is an experiment to help me think more about hwo we humans interface with computers each day.</p>
	<p>I am not sure what I will be doing next with my algorotoscope work. I have a whole queue of images I'd ike to train Tensorflow machine learning models on. Images that have interesting colors and textures, as well as potentially meaning. I just can't afford the GPUs, except in small bursts--an ML model here, and an ML model there. The other constraint on my end is a shortage of new photos due to no travel during the coronavirus pandemic. Ultimately I will have to get more disciplined and creative when it comes to taking photos in my East Bay Oakland neighorhoods. Honestly, I think Oakland provides me with a wealth of imagery, textures, colors, and deep meaning to extract, borrow, and apply to some of my images, video, and other short and long form storytelling. I just need to do some more thinking about how I can help visualize how the Internet is being used to distor what is happening right now as COVID-19 makes it way around the world.</p>
