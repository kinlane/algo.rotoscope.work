title: The Persistence of Memory
description: This was one of the first filters I made. I like Dali. It was a logical place for me to start. The Persistence of Memory was my first push into finding a filter that would apply interesting textures, but would also potentially have some meaning for me. I was seriously struggling with my friends and families view of the world, and their memory of the past, and how it was impacting the present. This collection contains a variety of images I took as I traveled around my home state of Oregon, and reflect many of the distorted concepts and views of our past, and the present I am seeing across people I know.
