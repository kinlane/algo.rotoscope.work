title: Copper Circuit
description: This was one of the early filters I made as well trying to bring out the tech in the images I was applying filters to. I wanted to go in a different direction than just stealing from artists that came before this wave of technology, and focus more on the underlying silicon of all of this. Ultimately I trained about five separate circuit ML models, but this is one that consistently delivers interesting shadows and distortion on the images I am taking and running through it.
