title: The Birth of a Nation
description: I identified this image a while back, but only began working on turning it into a filter recently, a processed I just finished during all of the protests here in Oakland. I had been looking for images that reflect the deep rooted systemic illnesses we are seeing bubbling up with our society. With this collection I am not celebrating a Birth of a Nation, but showing how it is baked into the very fabric of what we consider to be American. A part of our identity we have to be honest about and begin the hard work to reconcile what is wrong with this nation.
