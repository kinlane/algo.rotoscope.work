title: America Immigration Dumping Ground
description: I wanted to find images to train machine learning models on that would show that much of what is happening right now isn't now. It is a lot of the same old tired rhetoric just being amplified, automated, and optimized using the Internet. Leveraging algorithms to target individuals online using Facebook, Twitter, and other common platforms, using the web to spread the same old hate that has been bubbling up in this country since its beginning.
